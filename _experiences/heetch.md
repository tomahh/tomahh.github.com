Alongside developing new features for the iOS application, I managed the whole mobile development team during my first year and a half at Heetch.

During this time, I introduced reactive programming (using rxswift and rxjava) in the codebases, was doing code review on both platforms, planned the migration from objective-c to swift, implemented new iOS screens, contributed to our API redesign and gave feedback on product evolution.

After that, when the team grew, I focused on client-server communications. This implied designing the evolution of our protocol, adding key performance indicator monitoring and implementing new feature on the whole stack (swift, ruby and go).
