I was a member of the web product team. The biggest project I took on was a rebuild of the companyâ€™s integration with the PayPal API. I had to compose with existing code and subscriptions that would need to stay functional after the modifications I made.

I was also asked to create new API endpoints and their respective front-end interface (the API was written using Ruby-on-Rails and the front-end using Ember.js).

I also made modifications to the chat servers that were written with Python using Tornado.

But what I remember the most from my experience at Twitch was experiencing the workflows of a bay-area start up. It was also my first english-based work experience.
