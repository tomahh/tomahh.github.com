The company was developing, amongst other things, a skeleton application for restaurants. I worked on a refactoring of the memory and network management of this app.

I also built from scratch a small advertising application for a Taxi company (Taxi Cannes).

During the last 2 months of my internship, I took on the bootstrapping of a new application that was meant to be the mobile front-end for a 3rd party taxi reservation system. In this scope, I wrote a user management system using PHP and Symfony and created the iOS client app.
