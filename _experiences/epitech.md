In the scope of my end-of-first-year internship, I took a position within the school's administration. I was a teaching assistant for 1st year students, and helped them through numerous projects, all of them written in C.

It was a great experiment that helped me consolidate the knowledge I acquired the year before. Aside from that, I also built an automatic correction program using Python and took on an experiment building a drawing software using the Microsoft Kinect.
